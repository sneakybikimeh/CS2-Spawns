# CS2-Spawns
This Spawn.cfg file allow you to teleport to each official CS2 map spawns very easily.

## Installation
1. Open the archive and extract the file spawns.cfg into the following path folder :

        ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\
   
2. Launch the game, start a map with `sv_cheats 1` enabled and type in the console the following command: `exec spawns.cfg`.

## Usage
This config creates aliases to each spawn location of the officials CS2 maps.
The format for quick access is `[mapname]_[side]_[number]`, for example typing the following in your console `nuke_ct_1` will teleport you to the first spawn on the CT side on de_nuke.

## Future Update
I'm planning on adding a more advanced version of this file which will include other commands to easily switch in between spawns on a given map/side, just need to double check the data is fully accurate first.
